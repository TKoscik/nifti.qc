# nifti.qc

NIFTI.QC is an open-source project with the goal of implementing neuroimage quality control metrics in the [R software environment for statistical computing and graphics](https://www.r-project.org/). 

nifti.qc derives from, and is heavily influenced by [MRIQC](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and the [PCP Quality Assessment Protocol](http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/quality-assessment-protocol/index.html)
